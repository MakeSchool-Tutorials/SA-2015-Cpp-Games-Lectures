User testing is the process of having users use your app or game so that you can learn how to improve it by observing their interactions.

The most important rule of user testing is that *you must not interfere*.

The best testers are people that have never seen your app, and that don't know you. That way, their interaction will not be biased and their feedback will be more honest.

#Lecture Notes

##What is User Testing?

* User testing is using your app with the intent of learning about it.

* There are two kinds of testing. 1. To learn about user behavior. 2. Testing to find bugs and find the limits of your app. How you test changes depending on your goal, so make sure you know what you’re information you’re looking to gain before you begin.

* Testing for user behavior is about looking for what users struggle with, enjoy, and most importantly what they *do* when simply given your app. 

##Do Not Interfere

* When looking for user behavior, you *must not interfere*. When a user picks up your app you won’t be there to help them figure things out, so you must not talk to or help your play tester in order to get a realistic testing session.

* It’s worth mentioning again that you *must not* talk to your test user. It will be incredibly difficult to resist talking to your user if you see them struggle and they are asking you questions for help. You must not do this. 

* Okay okay, there is one time you should talk to your tester. That’s if they’ve been stuck for an extended period of time and are about ready to give up, but you want to test content past the point they are stuck at. You have failed. Make note of where the user got stuck, fix it later. Tell the user only what they need to know, and let them continue testing. Remember though that the information you gain past this point is tainted, and treat it accordingly. 

##Testing your Own App

* You are your worst test user. You know more about your app than anyone else will, and you’re also more invested in your app than anyone else. For games, if you think your game is at the right difficulty, your game is probably at least twice as hard as it should be. 

* Break your habits when testing. Do things in new orders, do things poorly, tap faster or slower than you usually do, use things you never use.

* Stress test your app. Tap buttons a million times, use multiple inputs at once, go through pages in orders users never should. Use the most extreme strategies and use cases you can think of. Find your apps limits.

* Explore every part of your app. If you have a game with 500 levels, you should have payed every single one of them. You should be able to tell me how to get from anywhere in your app to any other place in your game off the top of your head from memory while sleep deprived. 

##Who Should Test?

* So who should you chose to test your app?
	* Important factors when choosing a tester are their age, your target audience, how well you know them, and their experience.

	* When testing for player behavior you should choose the youngest user that can still understand your app and is in your target audience. Children can be brutally honest and it’s generally easier to tell if they are enjoying your app.

	* People completely unfamiliar with your app are far and away the best testers for looking at user behavior and your onboarding/tutorial. New users won’t know anything about your app, so chose testers who don’t either. Users familiar with your app are good for testing advanced mechanics which require mastery, or for looking for bugs as they know their way around the app and how it should behave. 

* You must keep your target audience in mind. If you’re making a hardcore game, someone whose only gaming experience is FarmVille is probably not an appropriate choice. If you are making an app about car repair, a mechanic will have a very different opinion than someone who has never fixed a car.

* Your friends and family are probably not going to tell you your app is a mess. Strangers won’t let your relationship with them cloud their opinion of your app, and therefore make the best testers.

* Ultimately, you won’t always be able to find perfect testers. You need to keep in mind what bias your play tester may have, and weight their feedback accordingly.

##User Feedback

* Users may ask for a faster horse when they really want a car. This doesn’t mean disregard feedback, it just means look for what the root of their feedback is.

* 20% of what you learn from testing is what users tell you. 80% is watching what they do, where they tap, where they struggle. Do they read your instructions or skip all of it? If you’re not watching your users screen, you might as well not be testing.
